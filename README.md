  ## 📘 Description of Project:

  
  Project was to create a back end e-commerce application so products can be stored in a central database and be connected with tags and categories. Products, categories, and tags can all be updated, deleted, as well as created. Would be a very good application for any business that has many products they would like to get organized with specific categories.
